## Running Locally

### Example Project

This repo provides an example project which is intended to be used while developing `react-models` and can be found in the `example` directory.

**In one terminal:**

- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

This will watch for changes to the `react-models` project and automatically update the example project.

**In a second terminal:**

- `cd example`
- follow the `Running Locally` guidelines in `example/README.md`

This will spin up a react website that hot reloads changes to `src/*`.
